#Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe tech test undertaken as part of the Makers Academy tech test week.

## The brief

The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

* There are two players in the game (X and O)
* Players take turns until the game is over
* A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
* A turn ends when a player claims a field
* A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
* A game is over if a player wins
* A game is over when all fields are taken

Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.

## Thought Process

I started with some research into hash tables in JavaScript to help fuel my design process. This helped me plan what data structures I wanted to use within my code. After this I set up my test framework.
